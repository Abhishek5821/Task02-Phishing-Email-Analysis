# 📄 Phishing Email Analysis Report

## 📨 Sample Email Text:
> “We noticed suspicious activity in your Google account. Please login immediately to verify your identity. If you don’t, your account will be deactivated.  
> [Click here to secure your account]”

---

## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Found:

1. **Sender's Email**  
   - Not shown, but assumed fake or similar to: `security@googl3.com`  
   - Misspelled domain is a red flag.

2. **Suspicious Link**  
   - The link says "Click here" but would redirect to a fake login page.  
   - You can't see the actual URL — **lack of transparency**.

3. **Urgent / Threatening Language**  
   - "Your account will be deactivated."  
   - This is classic **scare tactic** used in phishing.

4. **Generic Message**  
   - No name, no account details — clearly not personalized.  
   - Big companies always address you by your name.

5. **Spelling & Grammar**  
   - Slightly awkward sentence: “Please login” → should be “log in”  
   - Minor error but contributes to suspicion.

6. **No Official Branding**  
   - Real Google emails have logos, formatting, and footer info.

## ✅ Conclusion:
This email is a classic **phishing attempt** aimed at stealing your Google credentials. Never click on such links, especially if it seems suspicious.
