## üì© Sample Email Text:

> ‚ÄúWe noticed suspicious activity in your Google account. Please login immediately to verify your identity.  
> If you don‚Äôt, your account will be deactivated.  
> [Click here to secure your account]‚Äù

---

## üö© Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. **Suspicious Sender Address**  
   - The original email is likely from a fake Google-like domain (e.g., `security@googl3.com`), not `@google.com`.

2. **Deceptive Link**  
   - Link text is "Click here", but the real URL leads to a fake login page.  
   - Hiding the URL is a red flag.

3. **Scare Tactics**  
   - Language like "suspicious activity", "verify your identity", and "your account will be deactivated" is designed to create panic.

4. **Generic Message**  
   - No personal greeting or account details, which legitimate services usually include.

5. **Grammar Warning**  
   - Slightly off: ‚ÄúPlease login‚Äù should be ‚Äúlog in‚Äù.  
   - Big companies have professional communication.

6. **Missing Branding**  
   - No Google logo, footer, or other visual authenticity cues.

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion:
